# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This repository contains a simple command-line implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe written in C++. You can play against another person or challenge the computer.

## Features
- Choose between human vs. human or human vs. computer mode.
- Board is displayed after each move.
- Basic computer logic to respond to your plays.

## Building
Use a C++17 compatible compiler such as `g++`:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 L4-2.cpp ticTacToe.cpp -o TicTacToe
```

## Running
Execute the game after compiling:

```bash
./TicTacToe
```

Follow the prompts to select who goes first and enter your moves as `row column` values.

Enjoy!
